                    <h3 class="section-heading"> </h3>
                    <p class="lead"> To collaborate with diverse communities to design, build, test, and implement wind powered technology utilizing both the cultural characteristics of our customers and the technical capabilities of community environments. Through our work, we aim to serve society by developing sustainable, safe and functional devices that act as educational tools to both the team and the end users. </p> <hr /> 
                    <p class="lead">BLUElab Woven Wind is an engineering design team focused on wind energy and sustainability. In the past, the team has worked with rural communities in Guatemala to design and build a small-scale wind turbine to charge cellphone batteries.</p> 
                    <p class="lead"> In 2014, we transitioned towards creating wind turbines to be used as educational tools. We began our venture by working with Allen Elementary School in Ann Arbor. We designed and implemented a wind turbine with a 5th grade class to power a small application, such as a cellphone, in their classroom. While this project refined our technical experience working with wind technology, we also worked closesly with the class teacher and planned hands-on activites for the 5th graders to help them see a real world demonstration of their science curriculum. </p> 
                    <p class="lead">In the future, we plan to continue creating wind turbines for educational purposes. We will continue working locally in Ann Arbor, as well as internationally in Guatemala and El Salvador, where we have collaborators that are planning similar activites and technologies for their respective communities. </p>

                    <p class="lead"> 
                    A2 STEAM at Northside is a new K-8 school in the Ann Arbor school district. This school represents a new and innovative way of teaching kids. They are focused on hands-on project based learning and have a passion for developing an innovative way of thinking. To find out more about A2 STEAM, check out their website: http://www.a2schools.org/a2steam.home/home </p> <hr /> 

                    <h3 class="section-heading"> What Are We Doing? </h3> 
                    <p class="lead">We are working with our partner, Cindy Johengen, once again as well the other fifth grade classrooms at A2 STEAM to educate students about wind turbines. We have already had several educational workshops on the blades, anemometers, and wind turbines in general and will continue visiting the school throughout the year. While this is going on at the school we are working on designing and analyzing our plans for our new turbine</p> 

                    <h3 class="section-heading"> What Is Our Goal? </h3> 
                    <p class="lead"> Our final goal of this year's project is to implement a turbine that can be left up at A2 STEAM for extended periods of time without Woven Wind supervision. We want this to happen so students and teachers can have access to it to learn at their own convenience.</p> <br> <br>
