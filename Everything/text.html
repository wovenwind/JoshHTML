        <title> This goes above the webpage on the top of browser window </title>

    <body>
        <h1> This is the body of my first Webpage! It is cool!</h1>
        
        <p> I don't really know what to say here, but it this is the paragraph text</p>
        
        <p> This is another paragraph. We can add <b> Bold Letters </b> to it too! </p>
        
        <p> We can also add <i>italics</i> like this! </p>
        
        <p> Futhermore, for equations like E = MC<sup>2</sup> we can add superscripts </p>
        
        <p> As well as subscripts for things like H<sub>2</sub>O </p>
        
        <h2> This is another, smaller heading within the body </h2>
        
        <p> Even is we have          big         gaps      in     a    line, html will still
        create single spaces between words </p>
    
        <p> Unless we put in linebreaks like this <br /> This creates a break <br /> it doesn't need a closing tag, this is a form of an empty element. </p>
        <hr />
        
        <p> The line above is another empty element. Empty elements contain only one tag with a space and forward slash. The empty element above creates a break between themes.</p>
        
        
        <h3> These next things are semantic markups. They do not really change layout of page, but help with search engine optimization and can add extra information to a page </h3>
        
        <p> The tag <strong> strong </strong> indicates an element has importance. Browsers usually place <strong> strong </strong> elements in bold </p>
        
        <p> The <em> em </em> tag indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. This is placed in italics by the browser </p>
        
        <blockquote> The blockquote element is used for longer quotes that take up paragraphs. However, the p element is still used in the block quote. </blockquote>
        
        <p> Blockquotes are usually indented. <q> Shorter quotes use the q tagline </q> </p>
        
        <p> You can use the <abbr title = "Abbreviation"> Abbr </abbr> tag to create abbreviations. You can also add the full title of the abbr inside this tag </p>
        
        <p> The same thing goes for acronyms like <acronym title = "Evanston Township High School"> ETHS </acronym> It is so crazy! </p>
        
        <p> The address tag allow contanct information to be displayed on the webpage as such </p>
        <address> <p> <a href= "mailto:jjlustig@umich.edu"> jonathan@umich.edu </a> More information about this shit can be found with <strong> hcards </strong> and <strong> href </strong> tags </p> </address>
        
        <p> Another really <del> sucky </del> <ins> cool </ins> thing is the insert and delete tags. <br />
        They allow you to add and delete things. The same thing goes for the <s> big boy </s> s element whihc crosses out <s> big boys </s> </p>
